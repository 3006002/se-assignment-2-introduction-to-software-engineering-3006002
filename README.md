   Questions: Define Software Engineering:

This is a branch of computer science that deals with the design, development, testing and deployment of software applications.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software engineering is the design, development, testing and deployment of software applications, It differs from traditional programming because it is involved in the entire life cycle of the said application from conception through deployment to maintenance while programming solely focuses on the code.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

This is the structured process that enables developers produce high quality, low-cost software in the shortes time possible thus meeting and exceeding the customers demands and expectations.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.

1.Planing Phase : This phase involves all aspects of project and product management i.e resource allocation, capacity planning, project scheduling, cost estimation, and provisioning. During this phase development team collects input from stakeholders involved in the project; customers, sales, internal and external experts, and developers. This input is synthesized into a detailed definition of the requirements for creating the desired software. The team also determines what resources are required to satisfy the project requirements, and then infers the associated cost and all expectations are clearly defined they also determine what is not expected of the software alongside the desired expectations.

Project plans, estimated costs, schedules and procurement needs are produced in phase.

2.Coding Phase : This includes system design in an integrated development environment. It also includes static code analysis and code review for multiple types of devices.

3.Building Phase : Here the developers take the code requirements determined earlier and uses those to begin actually building the software.

4.Testing Phase : Entails the evaluation of the created software. The testing team evaluates the developed product in order to assess whether it meets the requirements specified in the ‘planning’ phase. It entails the performance of functional testing: unit testing, code quality testing, integration testing, system testing, security testing, performance testing and acceptance testing, as well as nonfunctional testing. If a defect is identified, developers are notified. Validated (actual) defects are resolved, and a new version of the software is produced.

5.Release Phase : Involves the team packaging, managing and deploying releases across different environments.

6.Deploy Phase : Here the software is officially released into the production environment.

7.Operate Phase : This the use of the software in the production environment.

8.Monitor Phase : Various elements of the software are monitored here. These could include the overall system performance, user experience, new security vulnerabilities, an analysis of bugs or errors in the system.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:

Agile : The agile methodology produces ongoing release cycles, each featuring small, incremental changes from the previous release. At each iteration, the product is tested. The agile model helps teams identify and address small issues in projects before they evolve into more significant problems. Teams can also engage business stakeholders and get their feedback throughout the development process.

Waterfall : The waterfal methodology is the oldest, simplest, and most structured methodology. Each phase depen…
